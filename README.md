- 👋 Hi, I’m @kreiss1 and I received my electrical engineer degree from INSA Lyon and a MsC Degree from Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 in a double degree program, both in 2016. In 2019, I received the Ph.D. degree in Automatic Control from INSA Lyon. From October 2019 to August 2020, I joined Ecole Centrale de Lyon as a teaching assistant and I became an assistant professor in September 2020 at Université de Lorraine.
